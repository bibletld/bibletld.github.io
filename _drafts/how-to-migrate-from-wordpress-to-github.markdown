The most popular site builder on the internet is [WordPress](http://wordpress.org/), with over 30% of known websites powered by [WordPress](http://wordpress.org/), at the time of this post. The number of site builders available continues to increase. There are also static site builders and hosting services, of which GitHub Pages is one of them. 

Why are there so many different site builders? Do we need so many of them? Well, different people have different preferences. And site builders and hosting services have their similarities and differences.

At certain moments in time, people and organizations change from one site builder--also known as, content management system (CMS)--to another one. 

To find out how easy or how difficult it would be to migrate from WordPress to GitHub Pages, we researched on the web, and here's what we discovered.

## Why Switch Away from WordPress

* though wordpress.com has a free version, that also comes with ads and limitations
* wordpress.com is pay-to-play if you want plugins, customization, and no ads
* wordpress.org allows you to run a self-installed CMS and that requires a paid hosting service

## Why Switch to GitHub Pages

* GitHub Pages runs on free hosting
* GitHub Pages serves up static pages, so it is lightning fast
* no advertising on its web pages

## What you need to know about GitHub Pages

* you have to know how to use Markdown (not an absolute have-to, because of next point)
* there are visual editors available via services like SiteLeaf and Forestry (unlike the built-in visual editor of WordPress)
* you'll need to work thru intricately detailed technical steps (unlike the WordPress one-click install)
