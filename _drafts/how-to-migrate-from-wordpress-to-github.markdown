The most popular site builder on the internet is [WordPress](http://wordpress.org/), with over 30% of known websites powered by [WordPress](http://wordpress.org/), at the time of this post. The number of site builders available continues to increase. There are also static site builders and hosting services, of which GitHub Pages is one of them.
